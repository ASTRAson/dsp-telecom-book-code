1) Original files:
 
Some files are from the GSM Scanner Project. Also, the GSMSP challenge provided GSM waveforms to be decoded. Results obtained by Mr. Tore for the challenge were releasesd at the GSMSP page. He showed how to interpret the GSM waveforms using modified GSMsim Octave / Matlab code. The original files are in GSMSPcode.zip.  Read The_Beginners_Guide_to_analyzing_GSM_data_in_MatLab.pdf.
In the zip, you can find 3 GSM waveforms: GSMSP_20070204_robert_dbsrx_941.0MHz_128.cfile, GSMSP_20070204_robert_dbsrx_953.6MHz_64.cfile and GSMSP_20070204_robert_dbsrx_953.6MHz_128.cfile. To execute Tore's code, unzip GSMSPcode.zip and execute the scripts step1.m, step2.m and step3.m.

2) Modifications made at UFPA

I added some comments and tried to make the code clearer to our students. These versions have the prefix ak_ and you can run script ak_runAllSteps.m to execute these modified versions.
